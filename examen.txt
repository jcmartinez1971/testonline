<exp>B and C are correct. Both /etc/bashrc and ~/.bashrc are used to configure non-login
shell sessions, although other files may be used on some distributions.
A, D, and E are incorrect. The /etc/profile, ~/.profile, and ~/.bash_profile files are used to
configure login shell sessions. (Domain 2: Systems Operation and Maintenance)</exp>

<opt>B. help ls</opt>

<opt>C. ls -h</opt>

<opt>D. man ls</opt>

a single character, and the X key is used by the vi editor to delete a single character.

/etc/yum and /etc/yum.repos.d files point to software installation repositories. (Domain 1:
